# What is R?

## What is R?

* Powerful, free, open source.
* Part programming language, part data analysis package.
* An implementation of the S language.
* Written by Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman.
* SAS/SPSS have <15 add-ons, R has over 6400!
* Most popular environment for developing new analysis and vis methods.


## The SAS/SPSS Way

1. Data input and management
2. Stats and graphics procedures
3. Output management systems
4. Macro language
5. Matrix language


## The R Way

All of these concepts are built into the (single) core language.


## Comparing R to Other Tools

* R can be harder to "get going" than other analysis tools.
* But once you do...
* Hastily becoming the "lingua franca".



# R Extensions

## Extensions

* Community and commercial addons.
* Everything from sophisticated analyses to making your computer beep.
* Written in R, Fortran, C, C++ mostly.
* Performance can sometimes be an issue, but generally accurate.
* Package download trends:  https://dgrtwo.shinyapps.io/cranview/

## The CRAN

* Comprehensive R Archive Network.
* Open source only.
* Over 6400 packages.
* High standard of quality is vigorously enforced.
* Closest thing to a journal for stats software.

```r
install.packages("NameOfPackage")
```

## GitHub

* Many authors eschewing CRAN for GitHub.
* Faster bug fixes, faster bugs (maybe).

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("GitHubUserName/RepositoryName")
```


# R Interfaces

## Shiny

* System for creating your own gui's (webapp)
* Code is 100% R (but can use html/css/javascript/...)
* Community quickly getting flooded with webapps
